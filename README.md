# Getting Started with Smart Bank System

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In the project directory, you can run:

### Initially you can start with ' npm install' 

This will install all the required dependecies and also installs all the node_modeule packages.

### Next we can start our server `npm start`

This will run our application in the development mode.\
You can either Open [http://localhost:3000] or (http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

Now we can see that The page reloads once you make changes in the code.\
You may also see any warnings or lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

You can 'eject` at any time if you're dissatisfied with the configuration options or the build tool. With this command, your project will be free of the single build dependency.

To give you complete control, it will instead copy all configuration files and transitive dependencies (such webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) straight into your project. Using the exception of 'eject`, all of the commands will still function and point to the copied scripts for your customization. You're on your own at this point.

It is not necessary to use 'eject'at all. Small and medium deployments can benefit from the carefully chosen feature set, and you are under no need to use it. But we recognize that without customization, this tool wouldn't be very helpful.
